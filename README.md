MCS (multi client server) chat server in a nutshell :

-Limit joining user in server is 100.

-All user that joining server will experience 3 phase : join phase, main phase and quit phase.

Things that need to note in MCS client, when client finish join server now client can accept 'message' from server
client will obtain 'packet info' first and then at second, client will obtain real packet

'packet info' contain type of real packet and the size
